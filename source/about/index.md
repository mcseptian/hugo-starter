## Welcome to about page

This is my [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/). I just start to learn [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) about two year or so. I just wanna try some code that build web today. What is this? Do I need that line of logic? Yeah, of course. Well this page just rendered by [JavaScript framework](https://github.com/hexojs/) with [JavaScript library](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) to get html code from plain [github flavoured markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/).

For complete instruction of the tutorial, just hover your cursor over the image. You will see detailed explanation.

### JavaScript

Whenever I use my [blogger](https://mcseptian.blogspot.com/), it just make me start to think about what language that perfect to match html and css. I learn about basic JavaScript and fell in love with it.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. Yes it is. MD just as good as plain text with auto formatting. I like this to write some of my lines. I think I will keep the guide below, it's look good by the way.

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block
